# virtualPainter

This is a Python project that utilizes the OpenCV, MediaPipe, and NumPy libraries to create a virtual painter application. The application allows users to draw and paint on a video screen using their hand gestures. Users can choose from different colors such as red, green, yellow, and blue, and also have an eraser option to erase everything on the screen.

## Features
Real-time hand tracking: The application uses the MediaPipe library to detect and track the user's hand in real-time.

Drawing with hand gestures: Users can draw on the video screen by moving their index finger in front of the webcam.

Color selection: Users can choose different colors for drawing using index and middle finger together hovering to the color wanted.

Eraser functionality: The application provides an eraser option to erase everything on the screen.
